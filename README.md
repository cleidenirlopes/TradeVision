📊 How It Works
Data Collection
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock price data and additional features for different companies. The data is collected from reliable sources and compiled into a CSV file, which includes the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock price.
Company: The company's name.
Ticker: The stock ticker (MSFT, AAPL, etc.).
Open Price: The price of the stock at the beginning of the trading day.
Close Price: The price of the stock at the end of the trading day.
High Price: The highest price the stock reached during the day.
Low Price: The lowest price the stock reached during the day.
Volume: The total volume of stock traded during the day.
Moving Averages (10, 50, and 200 days): The average stock prices over specific periods.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): A measure of the speed and change of price movements.
Data Processing & Preprocessing
Once the data is collected, it's important to clean and preprocess the dataset before using it for machine learning predictions. This includes the following steps:

Handling Missing Values: Any missing values are handled using imputation techniques such as filling with the mean or median value or using advanced imputation models.

Feature Engineering: New features are created to improve the model's performance, such as:

Moving averages to help identify trends over time.
RSI to measure market conditions (overbought or oversold).
Volatility measures to assess how unpredictable a stock is.
Normalization: Data is normalized using Min-Max Scaling or Standardization to ensure all features are on a comparable scale, improving model accuracy.

Handling Outliers: Outliers that can distort the predictions are identified and either removed or treated appropriately.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
EDA is crucial for understanding the dataset and identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies. The following steps are part of the EDA process:

Data Distribution: Visualize the distribution of key features (e.g., stock prices, volumes, moving averages) using histograms and box plots.

Correlation Analysis: Perform a correlation analysis to identify how different variables (e.g., close price, volume, moving averages) relate to one another. This helps in understanding which features are important for the prediction model.

Time Series Analysis: Plot stock prices over time to understand historical trends and how they align with market events.

Trend Visualization: Use line charts to visualize stock price trends and moving averages over different time frames.

Stock Trend Prediction
Once the dataset is cleaned and features are prepared, we use machine learning models to predict the stock trends. The model processes historical data and predicts whether the stock price will go up 📈 or down 📉 over the selected prediction period.

Prediction Models Used:
Random Forest: A powerful ensemble model that is used for classification and regression tasks.
XGBoost: A gradient boosting algorithm known for its performance and efficiency.
🧑‍💻 Getting Started
Input your stock ticker:
In the sidebar, enter a stock ticker like MSFT, AAPL, or GOOGL.

Choose a prediction period:
Select from 1 week, 15 days, 1 month, or 6 months.

View the results:
Instantly see the company name, the latest closing price, and the prediction for the stock trend. Is the price going to rise or fall? Let the model guide you!

🎨 UI/UX Design
We've designed the interface to be clean and user-friendly, making your experience smooth and intuitive. The results are displayed dynamically, with the Company, Close Price, and Prediction in clear, bold fonts that make it easy to read.

Real-time data fetching: We display "📡 Fetching data for ticker" while the system gathers real-time information.
Data Alignment: Information is neatly aligned to ensure you focus on the essentials.
Visuals: The layout is designed to help you make decisions faster. 🧑‍💼
🤖 About the Machine Learning Model
The stock prediction model is based on historical stock data and uses a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or similar). The model was trained on a dataset with various features such as:

Opening price
Closing price
Volume
Moving Averages (10, 50, 200 days)
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
It predicts whether a stock will go up or down over the specified prediction period, making this tool perfect for traders and analysts alike. 📉📈
